# Game Engine Project!

## Introduction
Currently, I'm working on making a 3-D game engine!
It's something I've wanted to do for a while and I'm excited to work on this. I'm pretty much tweaking it every day as of writing this and it's been a hard learning experience but it really has been fun!

I hope to get a really good idea of OpenGL and get really deep into the world of computer graphics. I'm currently only working on this by myself learning from books, Youtube, and the LearnOpenGL site!

Even after probably 60-100 hours on this project it's not much... but slowly and steady!
Making sure to learn everything!


## Goals
- Create a bug-free engine that can make basic 3-D games
- A fairly nice GUI for the user to create objects
- To make a demo game for the engine like the game "Portal"

## Progress
- Learned how to make and made window with GLFW.
- Learned how to make and made a barebones fragment and vertex shader.
- Learned how to make and made uniforms and buffers.
- Learned how to make and made shapes with differnt sets of vertices and different modes
- Learned how to Texture Objects and made a basic Texture Class.
- Learned different types of Texturing techniques.

## To-Do List
- Abstract the program...
- Create classes for 3-D Shapes...
- Create a proper "Scene"
- Create movement for the camera...
